 * Notes on usage
 * --------------
 * This SmartApp requires an outdoor temperature sensor, as well as a thermostat that implements setHumiditySetpoint
 * method.  The virtual device type Smart Weather Station can be used for an outdoor temperature reading.  The
 * Nest thermostat code @notoriousbdg implements humidity controls:
